            # Weather Snapshot Project
            
            ## Goals
            The main goals of the projects are two-folds: 1. Gathered weather data of cities across the planet on a paticular date. With those datas, we can determined such question as whether a vocation on that date is suitable, etc. 2. Display them in graphs and host them in a website.
            
            This project combined every steps required in Data Analytics and Visualisation. It served to improve and utilized skills in Python libraries and creating a dynamic website to better host and display such findings.
            
            It is divided into several steps and organized into two main folders: [Data-Extaction](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Data-Extraction%20(Python)/API-Challenge) and [Web](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Web%20(HTML%20%26%20JS)). The results are displayed in the following links.
            
            ## Results
            To see the results please click on this links.https://hong-webport.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/landing.html.
            
            This is the first website I've built. It was designed to be able to be easily updated. Due to the free nature of the API, datas on only a single day can be displayed. Yet, since the coding for the extraction and visualization worked. New datas could be placed without much issues. Further improvements can be made such as automatic updates and other tweakings. That would involved other technologies which will be master in due time. 
            
            ## The Process: Data-Extraction
            
            Using Python and its libraires, I extracted data from reputable, external data sources, converted it into a spreadsheet and created some visualizations for analysis.
            
            #### Source of the Data
            The main source of the data is **Openweather API**. 
            
            #### Python Libraires
            
            *Requests* is the library for extracting the data from the API. *Pandas* for transforming and working with the data. *Matplotlib* is the main visualization tool due to its simplicity and speed. Others are imported to assist in creating the list of cities and examine the data with linear regression.

            For More Details on the code: Please check the [Readme in Data-Extaction](https://github.com/Hong-webport/Weather-SnapShot/tree/main/Data-Extraction%20(Python)/API-Challenge/README.md) folder.
            
            #### The Data Mined and Stored

            #### An Example of the Visualizations

            ## Web Display
            
            Using a combinations of CSS and Javascript, I displayed the visualizations and findings resulted from them, in multiple pages. This is the first time ever that I used such tools. My desired goal are to create a slight feeling of dynamism, easy navigation and lack of confusion. 
            
            #### Tools and Component
            
            *Bootstrap4* is a very easy to use tools for dynamism  and responsiveness.
            
            Thumbnails on the left are shortcuts for easy naigation. Keywords are for removing the confusion if they come up and stessing their importance.
            
            Due to my inexperiences, I made many mistakes and learned greatly from them. This project had taught me a ton on Bootstraps and CSS, that I would not have learned had I simply followed a template. This made me very glad.
            
            #### Charts to Display
            
            The goals are to display these and the trends which are observed from them.
            
            <img src="Openweather-Previews/web_(4).PNG" width="720px">
            
            While these are admittedly small, I want to work as best as I can with it, so that I can used the challenge for other projects.
            
            #### Navigation
            
            This landing page is the introduction and set the tone for all others wwith the exception of its long introduction. I had to be careful in avoiding making them too clustered.

            Either by clicking on the dropdown button on the navigation bar in "Visualization Graphs" or the thumbnails on the left.
            #### Mobile
            
            This is a page with analysis looked in a Mobile Screen.
